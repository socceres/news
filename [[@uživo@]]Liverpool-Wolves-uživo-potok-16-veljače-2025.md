Liverpool vs Wolves live stream: How to watch Premier League game online and on TV


Today’s Liverpool vs Wolves live stream sees the Reds presented with a great chance to get back to winning ways against a side sitting just one place above the relegation zone — and you can watch it from anywhere with a VPN.

The final Merseyside derby at Goodison Park delivered plenty of drama as James Tarkowski’s late equalizer was followed by a series of red cards. That means Liverpool manager Arne Slot, assistant Sipke Hulshoff and midfielder Curtis Jones will all miss the visit from Wolves, with Johnny Heitinga set to take charge. Cody Gapko is also a doubt due to injury but the Reds could welcome back Trent Alexander-Arnold after he featured in the closing stages against Everton.

Wolves will be hoping the Reds haven’t fully recovered from their midweek exertions as they seek to win their third game in succession. Vitor Pereira’s side climbed out of the relegation zone with a deserved 2-0 win over Aston Villa and followed it up with a comfortable victory over Blackburn in the FA Cup. They will now need to raise their game to another level if they hope to become just the second team this season to gain a league victory at Anfield.

After Arsenal’s win yesterday, Liverpool will want to respond with a victory. Can they gain all three points? Tune in to find out.
